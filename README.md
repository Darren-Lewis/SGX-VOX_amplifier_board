# SGX-VOX_amplifier_board

This repo contains 2 folders:
1. called "Oxygen sensor PCB V1.21" contains the PCB manufacture files
2. called "Oxygen_sensor_amp_PCB_SGX-VOX_Darren_Lewis" contains the Arduino code

JLC PCB is a great site for getting boards made cheaply.

This breakout board and Arduino code can be used for amplifying the output signal from the SGX-VOX oxygen sensor with 50x gain to allow the sensor to be easily used with an Arduino or similar microcontroller, or even just using a standard volt-meter. The voltage output from the SGX-VOX is very low, around 9mV - 62mV across the whole range from 21% oxygen to 100% oxygen. The voltage scales linearly with oxygen concentration.
